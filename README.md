As technology continues its rapid advance in most of the industries these days, the modern hospitality business is beginning to see the benefits. A well-developed management system for hotel businesses helps boost the companyâ€™s overall operations by making their processes more efficient thus making the customer experience better.

This hotel management application is designed for the hotel manager at the front desk for room bookings through the phone, walk-in bookings and check-in/check-out of customers. It also allows the manager to cancel bookings prior to the check-in date. 

C programming language has been used to design and build this application. Binary file systems have been used to maintain customer booking records as well as the room availability data.
